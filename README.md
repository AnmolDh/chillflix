# Yet Another Streaming Website (Early Development Stage)

Welcome to the YASW! This document provides an overview of the project, instructions for setting it up, and other important information for developers and contributors.

## Project Overview

Our Movie/TV Shows Streaming Website is an exciting project built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The website aims to provide users with a platform to stream movies and TV shows. At this stage, the project is in its early development phase, and your contributions are welcome to help shape it into a fully functional and user-friendly streaming platform.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store user data, content information, and more.
- **Express.js**: A Node.js framework for building the backend server and API endpoints.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment for executing server-side JavaScript.
- **Authentication**: Implement user authentication for user management.
- **Media Streaming**: Technologies for streaming video content.
- **Other Dependencies**: Various libraries and packages for enhanced functionality (specified in the project's package.json file).

## Getting Started

Before you can run and contribute to the project, you'll need to set up your development environment. Here are the steps to get started:

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js and npm**: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **MongoDB**: Install and set up MongoDB. You can download it from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/yasw.git
   ```

2. **Change Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd yasw
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   In both the root folder and the `client` folder, run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set environment variables for your MongoDB connection, API keys, and other sensitive information.

5. **Start the Development Server**:

   In the root directory, run:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command will start both the server and the React development server for the frontend.

6. **Access the Application**:

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to access the website's frontend.
